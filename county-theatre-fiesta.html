            <p>
              The Sauti Za Boma program is an extension of the Kenya
              International Theatre Festival (KITFest) audioplay masterclass and
              residency programs conducted in 2022 and 2023. This initiative
              aims to transfer knowledge from previously trained audio play
              artists to new artists and build new audio play skills by training
              artists from marginalized communities outside the capital city.
              These artists will learn to narrate their unique stories in their
              local contexts, languages, and cultures. The program builds on the
              success of a two-year collaboration between the Kenya
              International Theatre Festival Trust and Pro Helvetia, which
              imparted essential skills and knowledge to artists in developing
              and producing audio plays.
              <br /><br />

              Seeking to further build on the exchange and collaboration between
              Switzerland and Kenya, Sauti Za Boma will leverage this experience
              by working closely with Erik Altofer, the lead facilitator of the
              audioplay masterclasses, through online training sessions. Ten
              artists from Erikâ€™s previous masterclass and residency program
              will conduct similar and more engaging sessions in five local
              communities across Kenya. Six artists will be selected from each
              region and assigned two trained artists as their trainers. They
              will be tasked with creating at least two audio plays, resulting
              in ten new audio plays by the end of the program. The program aims
              to incorporate original music composed by musicians from the
              communities.

              program will be led by the Festival Ambassador with guidance from
              the festival management team.
